# Object-Detection-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
Developed an object detection model for autonomous vehicles using YOLO, capable of real-time detection of pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs. Utilized the "Self-Driving Cars" dataset and deployed a Flask-based web app with image upload and live video feed options for seamless interaction and navigation.
